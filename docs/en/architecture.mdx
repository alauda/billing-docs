# Architecture

![](../zh/assets/billing_flow.png)

The platform provides overall metering and billing capabilities through the cooperation of **ACP Cost Management Server** and **ACP Cost Management Agent** components:

- **ACP Cost Management Server**: You need to install this plugin in the `global` cluster in order to use the platform's metering and billing functions.

  - Interfaces with Clickhouse, responsible for receiving data reported by clients and storing it in the Clickhouse database, with no time limit on data storage.

  - Provides an API for querying metering and billing data.

  - Offers the ability to modify unit prices and currency unit configurations.

  - **Note**: The currency unit set by the platform currently only affects display purposes and does not support currency conversion between different units.

- **ACP Cost Management Agent**: You need to install this plugin in the cluster where metering and billing are planned, so that the platform can meter and bill the resources in the cluster.

  - Interfaces with Prometheus, providing an exporter to store metering and billing metrics data in Prometheus.

  - Connects to **ACP Cost Management Server**, aggregates and calculates the metering and billing data for all resources in the cluster from the previous day at 12:30 AM each day, and reports it to the server. If the report fails, it will attempt to resend every two hours until successful.
