# Operation Statistics

:::warning
Operation statistics is a legacy measurement feature provided by the platform. This functionality has been replaced by the new **Metering and Billing** features, which include cost model management, multiple billing methods, and project-level billing capabilities. 

For new deployments, please use the **Metering and Billing** functionality instead. Existing users should plan to migrate to the new billing system.

## Operation Overview

The operation overview of the platform presents a visual report showcasing the total usage of CPU/memory within the specified time range on the platform, along with usage statistics for the top 5 projects or namespaces.

It supports viewing project quotas for the current month (default), the last month, and the last 3 months (current month and the previous two complete months), and provides usage statistics for pods, pod quotas, namespace quotas, and total CPU/memory usage.

Steps to operate:

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Operation Statistics** > **Operation Overview**.

   You can switch the statistical time range, statistical items, and statistical granularity as illustrated, and view the corresponding operation overview data.

   **Note**: Pod usage is calculated based on the actual usage of Pods, while pod quotas are based on the request values (request) of Pods.

## Statistical Report

Operation statistics data can be retained on the platform for a maximum of 540 days, after which the platform will automatically delete statistics that exceed the retention period. It supports viewing visual report data for statistical items within a custom time range (maximum time range is 6 months). Filtering can be done based on statistical granularity (project, namespace) and project (all, custom projects).

Statistical items include: pod usage, pod quotas, project quotas, and namespace quotas. Additionally, clicking **Export Results** allows you to export the filtered statistical data as a CSV format report.

**Note**: Detailed data can only be viewed when the **Statistical Item** is `Pod Quota` or `Pod Usage`.

Steps to operate:

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Operation Statistics** > **Statistical Report**.

2. Follow the instructions in the illustration below to select the statistical time range, statistical items, and statistical granularity, then set the project filtering conditions and click the **Search** button to view the corresponding statistical report data.

   **Note**:

   - The platform retains data only within the past 540 days, and the maximum time range supported for a single query is 6 months.

   - Pod usage: Calculated based on the actual usage of Pods, summing the average usage calculated every 5 minutes.

   - Pod quotas: Calculated based on the request values (request) of Pods.

   - Namespace quotas: Calculated based on the CPU and memory quotas of the namespace, with statistics taken once daily, beginning the day after quota changes.

   - Project quotas: Calculated based on the CPU and memory quotas of the project, calculated once daily, beginning the day after quota changes.

   - Detailed data can be viewed when the **Statistical Item** is `Pod Quota` or `Pod Usage`.

   - Sorting is available based on **Namespace Name** (first letter), **Belonging Project** (first letter), **Total CPU Usage** (size), and **Total Memory Usage** (size).

## Metering Details

The platform retains usage detail data for nearly 18 months and supports querying visual report detail data within a custom time range (within the last 31 days) for statistical items.

Filtering can be conducted based on statistical items (pod usage, pod quotas), project name, project associated cluster, and namespaces under the cluster. Additionally, clicking **Export Results** allows you to export the filtered statistical data as a CSV format report.

Steps to operate:

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Operation Statistics** > **Metering Details**.

   **Or**: On the **Statistical Report** page, when the **Statistical Item** is `Pod Quota` or `Pod Usage`, click the **Details** button on the right side of a single query result record to enter the metering details page and view the detailed data.

2. Follow the instructions in the illustration below to select the statistical time range, statistical items, project, cluster, and namespace, then click the **Search** button to view the corresponding usage detail data.

   **Note**:

   - The platform retains data only within the past 18 months, and the maximum time range supported for a single query is 31 days.

   - Pod usage: Calculated based on the actual usage of Pods, summing the average usage calculated every 5 minutes.

   - Pod quotas: Calculated based on the request values (request) of Pods.

   - Sorting is available based on **Pod Name** (first letter), **Total CPU Usage** (size), and **Total Memory Usage** (size).
