# Project-Level Billing

Project-level billing functionality provides cost visibility and management capabilities at the project level, allowing project administrators and developers to view costs for their own projects and namespaces.

## Overview

Project-level billing is available under the project management interface, providing a dedicated metering and billing section for project-specific cost analysis. This feature supports role-based access control, ensuring users can only view billing data for projects and namespaces they have permissions for.

## Access and Permissions

### Navigation

To access project-level billing:
1. Navigate to the project management interface
2. Locate the **Metering and Billing** section below **DevOps Tools** and above **Notifications**
3. The section contains two sub-pages: **Cost Statistics** and **Cost Details**

:::info
The Metering and Billing menu in project management is controlled by the metering and billing feature toggle.

### Permission Requirements

| Role | Permission | Access Scope |
|------|------------|--------------|
| Project Administrator | View all data | All data within the project |
| Namespace Administrator | View limited data | Only namespaces + clusters with permissions |
| Developer | View limited data | Only namespaces + clusters with permissions |

## Cost Statistics

Project-level cost statistics provide summarized cost information for projects and namespaces you have access to.

### Features

- Same display fields as platform-level cost statistics
- Automatic data filtering based on user permissions
- Support for time range selection, statistical granularity, and billing item filtering
- Usage statistics alongside cost information

### Data Filtering Rules

**Project-level roles (Project Administrator):**
- Can view all data within the current project
- Access to all namespaces and clusters associated with the project

**Namespace-level roles (Namespace Administrator, Developer):**
- Can only view data for namespaces + cluster combinations they have permissions for
- Restricted to authorized resources only

### Usage

1. In the project management interface, click **Metering and Billing** > **Cost Statistics**

2. Configure your search criteria:
   - **Time Range**: Select the period for cost analysis
   - **Statistical Granularity**: Choose between project, namespace, or cluster views
   - **Billing Items**: Specify whether to display costs separately by item type
   - **Reporting Interval**: Select monthly, weekly, or daily intervals

3. Click **Search** to view the cost statistics

:::warning
Only the cost information of all clusters associated with the cost model is counted. If the billing data of a cluster is not queried, please contact the platform administrator to configure the cost model.
:::

## Cost Details

Project-level cost details allow you to query detailed billing records within your project scope.

### Features

- Same display fields as platform-level cost details
- Project filtering is hidden (automatically set to current project)
- Cluster and namespace filters are restricted based on permissions
- Support for search, column customization, and data export

### Filtering Restrictions

**Project Filter**: 
- Hidden from the interface
- Automatically restricted to the current project

**Cluster Filter**:
- Shows "All" and clusters associated with the current project
- For namespace-level roles: Only clusters with namespace permissions are available

**Namespace Filter**:
- Shows "All" and namespaces within the current project  
- For namespace-level roles: Only authorized namespaces are available

### Data Access Rules

**Project-level roles:**
- View all billing data within the project
- Access to all project namespaces and associated clusters

**Namespace-level roles:**
- View billing data only for authorized namespace + cluster combinations
- Restricted access based on individual permissions

### Usage

1. In the project management interface, click **Metering and Billing** > **Cost Details**

2. Configure your search criteria:
   - **Time Range**: Select the billing period to query (maximum 1 year)
   - **Cluster**: Choose from available clusters (based on permissions)
   - **Namespace**: Select from authorized namespaces
   - **Billing Item**: Filter by specific resource types
   - **Billing Method**: Filter by measurement method

3. Use additional features:
   - **Search by Name**: Find specific resources
   - **Column Settings**: Customize displayed fields
   - **Export**: Download data in CSV format
   - **Hide Zero Costs**: Toggle to exclude zero-cost records

4. Click **Search** to view the detailed billing records

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Project Cost Review
**User**: Project Administrator  
**Goal**: Review monthly costs for the entire project

1. Access **Cost Statistics** in project management
2. Set time range to "Current Month"
3. Select "Project" as statistical granularity  
4. Choose "Monthly" reporting interval
5. Enable "Distinguish Billing Items" to see breakdown by CPU, Memory, Storage

### Scenario 2: Namespace-Specific Analysis
**User**: Namespace Administrator  
**Goal**: Analyze detailed costs for specific namespaces

1. Access **Cost Details** in project management
2. Set appropriate time range
3. Select specific cluster and namespace from available options
4. Filter by billing item if needed
5. Export results for further analysis

### Scenario 3: Resource Optimization
**User**: Developer  
**Goal**: Identify high-cost resources in authorized namespaces

1. Use **Cost Details** to view resource-level billing
2. Sort by cost amount to identify expensive resources
3. Filter by resource type to focus on specific areas
4. Use search functionality to find specific workloads

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Available
If you don't see any billing data:

1. **Check Permissions**: Verify you have access to the project/namespaces
2. **Cost Model Association**: Ensure clusters are associated with cost models
3. **Time Range**: Confirm the selected time range contains billing periods
4. **Component Installation**: Verify metering/billing components are installed

### Limited Data Visibility
If you see less data than expected:

1. **Role Verification**: Confirm your role and associated permissions
2. **Namespace Access**: Check which namespaces you have access to
3. **Cluster Associations**: Verify which clusters are linked to your authorized namespaces

### Contact Support
For billing data issues beyond your access scope:
- Contact your platform administrator to configure cost models
- Request additional permissions if needed
- Report data inconsistencies to the platform team

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Review costs regularly to identify trends and anomalies
2. **Resource Tagging**: Use labels consistently for better cost attribution
3. **Budget Planning**: Use historical data to plan future resource allocation
4. **Team Communication**: Share cost insights with development teams
5. **Optimization Actions**: Act on cost analysis findings to optimize resource usage
