# Cost Details

The cost details feature allows you to query billing detail data within a custom time range (maximum span of 1 year), with a minimum granularity of **day**.

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Metering and Billing** > **Cost Details**.

2. After selecting the project, cluster, and namespace, click the **Search** button to view the corresponding cost details.

   **Note**:

   - The platform only supports data queries within a maximum period of one year.
   - Only clusters with associated cost models will show billing data. To configure cost models, read [Cost Model Management](./cost_model_management.mdx).
   - Unmounted PVs that are not attached to a pod will be counted as unmounted records, using the object name `*unmounted-pvcs`.
   - Supports search by name, column customization, and data export functionality.
