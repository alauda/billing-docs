# Metering and Billing

:::warning
Metering and billing is only an `Alpha` feature. You need to enable this feature by turning on the feature gate : `ait-billing`.
:::

## Cost Model Management

The cost model management feature allows platform administrators to define and manage billing models for different clusters. A cost model specifies which resources should be billed and at what rates.

Key features:
- **Create and manage cost models**: Define billing items, billing methods, and unit prices
- **Cluster association**: Bind cost models to specific clusters
- **Label-based pricing**: Set differentiated pricing based on labels
- **Lifecycle management**: Create, edit, delete, and view cost model details

Only clusters associated with a cost model will generate billing data. To configure cost models, go to **Metering and Billing** > **Cost Models**.

## Cost Statistics

The cost statistics feature supports analyzing resource costs on the platform across various dimensions. The supported dimensions are as follows:

- Time Granularity: Supports cost statistics based on project, cluster, or namespace.
- Reporting Interval: Supports cost statistics on a monthly, weekly, or daily basis.
- Distinguish Billing Items: You can specify whether to display the costs of each billing item separately, such as CPU, memory, or storage.
- Usage Statistics: View usage data alongside cost information

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Metering and Billing** > **Cost Statistics**.

2. After selecting the time granularity, reporting interval, whether to distinguish billing items, and defining the time range, configure the name filter, and click the **Search** button to view the corresponding statistical data.

   **Note**:

   - The platform only supports data queries within a maximum period of one year.
   - Only clusters with associated cost models will show billing data. To configure cost models, contact your platform administrator.

## Cost Details

The cost details feature allows you to query billing detail data within a custom time range (maximum span of 1 year), with a minimum granularity of **day**.

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Metering and Billing** > **Cost Details**.

2. After selecting the project, cluster, and namespace, click the **Search** button to view the corresponding cost details.

   **Note**:

   - The platform only supports data queries within a maximum period of one year.
   - Only clusters with associated cost models will show billing data. To configure cost models, contact your platform administrator.
   - Unmounted PVs that are not attached to a pod will be counted as unmounted records, using the object name `*unmounted-pvcs`.
   - Supports search by name, column customization, and data export functionality.

## Project-Level Billing

Project-level billing functionality provides cost visibility at the project level, allowing project administrators and developers to view costs for their own projects and namespaces.

- **Project Cost Statistics**: View cost summaries for projects you have access to
- **Project Cost Details**: View detailed billing records for your projects
- **Role-based access**: Different access levels based on project and namespace permissions

Access project-level billing through the project management interface under **Metering and Billing**.
