# Cost Statistics

The cost statistics feature supports analyzing resource costs on the platform across various dimensions. The supported dimensions are as follows:

- Statistics Granularity: Supports cost statistics based on project, cluster, or namespace.
- Interval: Supports cost statistics on a monthly, weekly, or daily basis.
- Separate Billing Items: You can specify whether to display the costs of each billing item separately, such as CPU, memory, or storage.
- Usage Statistics: View usage data alongside cost information

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Metering and Billing** > **Cost Statistics**.

2. After selecting the time granularity, reporting interval, whether to distinguish billing items, and defining the time range, configure the name filter, and click the **Search** button to view the corresponding statistical data.

   **Note**:

   - The platform only supports data queries within a maximum period of one year.
   - Only clusters with associated cost models will show billing data. To configure cost models, read [Cost Model Management](./cost_model_management.mdx).
