## 4.1.0

### Features and Enhancements

1. **Tenant-Level Metering and Billing**

2. **Usage Statistics**
- Both the platform-level and project-level expense statistics pages now support viewing usage statistics.

3. **Billing Model Management**

- Differential pricing can be set using resource tags (e.g., different prices for different GPU models).

4. **Universal Metering and Billing Solution**
- Provided a hot-pluggable universal metering and billing solution based on billing models, eliminating the need for product releases.
- Customizable for various products/customers.
- Requires collection and storage of billing-related metrics in the monitoring system.
