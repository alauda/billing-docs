# Installation

This article will introduce how to install the components required for metering and billing.

## Preinstall Considerations

- The **Cost Management Server** and **Cost Management Agent** work together to provide the overall metering and billing functionality of the platform. The server-side component supports data storage capabilities related to metering and billing, while the client-side component handles data collection and billing capabilities.

- The **Cost Management Server** component relies on ClickHouse as its data storage solution. You can either install the ACP Log Storage with Clickhouse plugin provided by the platform or install ClickHouse on your own for integration.

- The **Cost Management Agent** component requires that the corresponding cluster has the **ACP Monitor with Prometheus** monitoring component installed. Please ensure that this component is successfully installed in advance.
