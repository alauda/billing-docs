## Cost Statistics

The cost statistics feature supports analyzing resource costs on the platform across various dimensions. The supported dimensions are as follows:

- Time Granularity: Supports cost statistics based on project, cluster, or namespace.
- Reporting Interval: Supports cost statistics on a monthly, weekly, or daily basis.
- Distinguish Billing Items: You can specify whether to display the costs of each billing item separately, such as CPU, memory, or storage.

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Metering and Billing** > **Cost Statistics**.

2. After selecting the time granularity, reporting interval, whether to distinguish billing items, and defining the time range, configure the name filter, and click the **Search** button to view the corresponding statistical data.

   **Note**:

   - The platform only supports data queries within a maximum period of one year.

   - The currency unit used in the cost metric is determined by the configuration of the **Cost Management Server** plugin.

## Cost Details

The cost details feature allows you to query billing detail data within a custom time range (maximum span of 1 year), with a minimum granularity of **day**.

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Metering and Billing** > **Cost Details**.

2. After selecting the project, cluster, and namespace, click the **Search** button to view the corresponding cost details.

   **Note**:

   - The platform only supports data queries within a maximum period of one year.
