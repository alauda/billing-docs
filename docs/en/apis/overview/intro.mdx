# Introduction

<Term name="product" /> (<Term name="productShort" />) is a cloud-native platform where most functionalities are implemented through Kubernetes operators. The <Term name="productShort" /> API Reference documentation provides comprehensive information about the APIs available in <Term name="productShort" />.

## Types of APIs

### Advanced APIs

Some functionalities, such as log querying, are not suitable for exposure through Kubernetes APIs. For these cases, <Term name="productShort" /> provides RESTful APIs that can be accessed via HTTP requests. For a complete list of these APIs, refer to the [Advanced APIs](../advanced_apis/) section.

## API Authentication

Both <Term name="productShort" /> Kubernetes APIs and Advanced APIs use <Term name="productShort" /> user token for authentication and authorization. You only need to add the token to the `Authorization` header in your HTTP request:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://<acp-api-server-address>/apis/v1/namespaces/default/pods" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
```
